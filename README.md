# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Solutions to general DSA problems, constructions of various DSAs, etc.


Repository to keep any sort of application to Data Structures and Algorithms, whether it be my own solutions to textbook problems (Skienna Algorithm Design, etc.)
or a problem I've simply come across. There are subfolders regarding problems to specific textbook problems, ex. Skiena Algorithm Design.  
Please note that there is slight overlap with the LeetCode repo as that certainly has quite a few solutions to problems
dealing with DSA.
