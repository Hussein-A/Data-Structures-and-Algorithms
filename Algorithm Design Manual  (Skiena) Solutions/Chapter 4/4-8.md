Given a set of S containing n real numbers, and a real number X. We seek analgorithm to determine whether two elements of S exist whose sum is exactly X.  
(a)  Assume that S is unsorted. Give an O(nlogn) algorithm for the problem.    
(b)  Assume thatSis sorted. Give anO(n) algorithm for the problem.  
.  
***Solution***  
(a) Same idea as 4-6, sorting and using binary search. See 4-6 for more detail.  
(b) We will apply a similar idea as in 4-6, finding the remainder X-x2 in the original set.  
Create a new set (vector) Remainders with the same size as S where each element is the remainder of subtracting the respective element
of S from the target, X. Ie. Remainders[i] = X-S[i]; The remainder of the solution is more easily described by a code fragment.  
.  
*Code*  
```
int i = 0, j = 0;
while (i<n && j <n){
  if (S[i] == Remainders[i]) return true;
  
  if (S[i] < T[i]) ++i;
  else ++j;
}
return false;
```
