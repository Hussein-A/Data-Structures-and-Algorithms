4-6. Given two sets S1 and S2 (each of size n), and a number x,describe an O(nlogn) algorithm for finding whether there exists a pair of elements, one from S1 and one from S2, that add up to x.  
.  
***Solution***
Suppose there exists such an x1 and x2 (from S1 and S2 respectively) such that x1+x2 = X. Then we have X-x2 = x1. This gives us an idea for a potential algorithm. First 
sort one of the sets, say S1, in *O(nlogn)*. Iterate through each element of S2 and with each iteration subtract x2 from X and conduct a binary search
on S1 (which is sorted, taking *O(logn)*) to find a potential x1. Since there are *n* elements in S2 and each time we conduct a binary search which takes *O(logn)*
it follows that this algorithm will yield a result in *O(logn)* time.  
.  
*Code Fragment*  
```
int curr_target = 0;
int target = X;
sort(S1.begin(), S1.end());  

for (int x2 : S2){  
  curr_target = target-x2;
  if (binary_search(S1.begin(), S1.end(), curr_target)) return true;
}
return false;
```
