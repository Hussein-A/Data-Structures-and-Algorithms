6-17. Either prove the following or give a counterexample:   
1. Is the path between a pair of vertices in a minimum spanning tree of an udirected graph necessarily the shortest (minimum weight) path?   
2. Suppose that the minimum spanning tree of the graph is unique. Is the path etween a pair of vertices in a minimum spanning tree of 
an undirected graph ecessarily the shortest (minimum weight) path?   
.   

***Solution***   
1 No. Recall one of our earlier graphs on 4 vertices: 1-2 (1), 2-3 (2), 3-4 (3), 4-1 (4). Then the shortest path is from 1-4 at a cost
of 4 but the MST path is 1-2-3-4 at a cost of 6.   
2 No, see graph above. We need only show that the MST above is unique for the counter example to apply. But we have already shown this
in the proof for 6-4 in the same folder as this question is.
